# Open Fodder Installation instructions

## About

Open Fodder requires campaign and mission information, as well as the data files from a retail release of Cannon Fodder. These files must be installed to certain locations depending on your operating system, please see the details below for instructions.  


### OS Specific

#### Windows

Download the [installer package](https://github.com/OpenFodder/openfodder/releases).  

The Windows version of Open Fodder defaults to using and installing data to the location '%USERPROFILE%/Documents/OpenFodder'.  
While the demos will be installed as part of the Windows installer package, you will be required to copy a full retail release into this folder (following the instructions below, or when prompted to select it during the installer)
  
  
#### Linux / Unix

Open Fodder will check the environment variable $XDG_DATA_DIRS and iterate each path checking for the data folder "/OpenFodder/".  
Failure to locate the folder in these paths, will result in a check of $HOME/.local/share/OpenFodder.  
Failure on this path, will fall back to the current working directory.  
  
  
## Data

### Campaign Data

The campaign information was originally hardcoded in the executable, this is required to play and is downloadable alonside six demos from (https://github.com/OpenFodder/data/releases/download/1.7.0/Data.pack.1.7.0.zip).
